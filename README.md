## Idea
This workshop is based around rita and poem generating. 
Rhyming poems are what I always think about when I think of poems, so my apart from other nonsense, I just wanted the last words of 2 consecutive lines to rhyme. 
My idea was to write out exactly what the user inputs, then spit out a nonsense following line that rhymes with the user input. 

## RiTa functions used
this task was pretty straightforward - I simply researched a few functions from rita and implemented them. because Im familiar with arrays, I didnt run into any input issues. 
Rita reference pages used:
https://rednoise.org/rita/reference/postags.html
https://rednoise.org/rita/reference/RiTa/randomWord/index.html
https://rednoise.org/rita/reference/RiTa/isAdjective/index.html
https://rednoise.org/rita/reference/RiTa/pastPart/index.html

## adjectives
I had initially wanted to do something with the nouns but decided not to as this would be following the workshop too closely. I ended up changing the adjectives so the overall sentence still flowed rather than being complete nonsense

## Finishing and Next Steps
I added a cool handwritten font and made the backgound paper like as a little aesthetic bonus. 
next steps would be maybe a way to save the poem or create more texture.
