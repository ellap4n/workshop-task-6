## Idea
This workshop is based around rita and poem generating. 
Rhyming poems are what I always think about when I think of poems, so my apart from other nonsense, I just wanted the last words of 2 consecutive lines to rhyme. 
My idea was to write out exactly what the user inputs, then spit out a nonsense following line that rhymes with tehe user input.
